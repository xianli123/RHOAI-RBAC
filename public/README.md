# RHOAI UXD Prototypes

## Introduction

This repository contains code-based UX prototypes that are used to inform future experiences we build for Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI).

## Getting started

## Notes

* This repo contains internal-only context and forward-looking roadmap items and should not be cloned to GitHub or other public locations.
* In a future release (TBD) we may switch to using the real RHOAI Dashboard codebase [here](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard) instead.
